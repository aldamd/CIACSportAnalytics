# CIAC Sports Analytics [OUTDATED]
## Overview
This was a data analysis project I wrote for a friend. Every year he would have to manually collect yearly high school championship results and analyze the statistics for individual schools so I wrote him a script that would cut down the hours of work into <5 minutes. Unfortunately since this script was written in 2023, the website has undergone a complete transformation and the hard-coded scraping doesn't work. On the bright side my friend doesn't even work that beat any more!

## Results
The script would "asynchronously" scrape the HTML data of each sport page and collect championship results, keeping running data frames of each season's sports, the high school that won which sport in which class, along with runner-up data. The results were then summarized by the number of championship each high school won and output in a structured text file.
